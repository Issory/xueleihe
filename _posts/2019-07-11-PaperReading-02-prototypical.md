# Objective
few-shot classification

# Proposed
1. Prototpical Networks

# Advantage
1. learn a metric space

# Method
1. Compute mean features of support set samples as prototyical feature
    $${c_k=\frac{1}{|S_k|}\sum\nolimits_{(x_i,y_i)\in S_k} f_{\phi}(x_i)}$$, where $c_k$ is the prototype representation, $f_{\phi}$ is the embedding function and $\phi$ is the learnable parameters
2. loss is the euclidean distance between prototyical features and test features
    - $${p_{\phi}(y=k|x)=\frac{\exp(-d(f_{\phi}(x)),c_k)}{\sum_{k'}\exp(-d(f_{\phi}(x)),c_{k'})}}$$,
    where $d$ is the distance function.
    - $\arg\min J(\phi)=-\log p_{\phi}(y=k|x)$
